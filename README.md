Demostration with API SERVER works only locally. Quick start:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Enter the directory cd demo-book-list_react and SWITCH to DEVELOP branch
3. Install dependencies: npm i to USE API options.
4. Run npm run dev to start APP and SERVER at once by one command.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
6. Server works on http://localhost:3010, you can check it with request to http://localhost:3010/events to view it in the browser.
If something went wrong, you always are able to repeat 1-6 or ask Me Why?)
